# GSI-Inventory-Management-ElectronAPP
Manual Inventory Management is a challenge for government organizations like GSI since they cannot provide employees with high-end software technologies.
My father works in GSI and my motive for this project was to help him with the management of machineries.
It makes easier for the admin to add machines, add people & assign inventory to people or revoke from them.

I have created a desktop application using ElectronJS framework that can work offline on any computer. The application stores data locally using MySQL server.
